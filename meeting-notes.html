                <div class="border">
                    <h2>Meeting April 20, 2024</h2>
                    <b>Attendees:</b> Sharon, Jenneif, Carol, Harriette, David, Hope, Michell, Marlene, Mark.
                    <h2>Topics</h2>
                    <b>Urgent TODOs:</b> Get final list of attendees. Breakdown of adults and children (ages). Food
                    allergies. T-shirt sizes for ordering.
                    <b>Reunion lodging:</b> Marriott and Staybridge are right across the street from each other, so very
                    close.
                    Marriott plain rooms for the $169 price. The Staybridge Hotel rooms will be more like suites. They will
                    have stoves, microwaves, and refrigerators.
                    Meet and Greet: will be at the Staybridge.
                    <b>Dues:</b> Details were discussed. Set at $25/per person. Further discussion of family dues vs. per
                    person or per adult person. Trying to maximize dues income for resource while still minimizing financial
                    burdens. Dues will help to offset property taxes and upkeep offering Resource. Bank account is set up
                    and ready. Carol and Harriette are joint. Access through Zell or a check. Discussion of access methods:
                    email and phone numbers to use. Dues will be separate from reunion fees. Reunion fees haven't been
                    decided on yet. Discussion of delaying requesting dues until next year if property taxes have already
                    been paid by Patrick. Uses for dues should be discussed at the reunion.
                    <b>Committee meetings:</b> none so far. Need to get one set up for food committee to get work up a menu.
                    Genealogy comittee June 5th
                    <b>Attendees</b> Number and breakdown of attendees still not final. Adults and children. About 70 people
                    came to mind.
                    <b>Activities:</b> Dependent on interest and number of children. Discussion of where to have activities;
                    inside or outside. Type and length of activities. Noted that Tiara, on activities committee, was
                    thinking of combined activities for adults and children. Watch a school baseball game nearby. Possible
                    Zumba class.
                    Genealogy presentations and surveys. Dominos. Grills available at the Staybridge. Maybe a cooking
                    station as part of health and wellness. Saturday meet-n-greet on Saturday. Setup a health and wellness
                    area. A tv will be available for posting of personal videos. Presentation on Resource property.
                    Identify old photos. Interview and record elders on family knowledge. Scan photos with iPhones etc.
                    <b>Reunion Food: </b> Need to get menus and meals planning going to see about costs. Need to ask people
                    about any allergies or dietary restrictions.
                    <b>Genealogy:</b> Hope shared information she has printed from Ancestry. People with Ancestry or Family
                    Search would share their trees with whoever wanted to see them. Noted that spellings and dates sometimes
                    varied widely. Different documens have different spellings of names. Influenced by whoever was writing
                    the record at the time. Discussion of Mimi's family tree and the Hazels. Sometimes formerly the Jamaican
                    registrar's put the birthday as the registration day and not the actual date of birth. Same with the
                    spelling used by the Registrar, misspelled names went uncorrected. Search for Carol's family data.
                    <b>T-Shirts</b> Discussion of cost, design, color, style (collar or none) order sizes. Maybe just re-use
                    the previous design. Shirts for everyone at the reunion. They will also be available to order for anyone
                    else who wants one. Need to get proactive on design and ordering since turnaround time is getting short.
                    People will look for the order form that was used last time.
                    <b>Newsletter/Website</b> Discussed need for a Newsletter and someone to write it. Could important
                    information be shared on the website and direct people to it. If anyone who doesn't attend Zoom meetings
                    shows any interest then direct them to the website. There is very little response to Sharon's emails.
                    Hopefully at least one person per branch could check-in and provide thoughts and direction. Website is
                    not private but public and discoverable by anyone. Personal, private, and sensitive data should not be
                    shared on the website. Still looking someone interested in writing the newsletter. Question of
                    would/could we share sensitive information on the Resource FB page since it is a closed group.
                    Genealogy: should we share ancestor information for anyone who isn't living as is the default on most
                    genealogic websites.
                    <b>Resource property:</b> Taxes are roughly 400/year. USD or Jamaican money? Patrick has been paying the
                    taxes for the last couple of years. Marlene noted that her mother used to pay taxes. Then Leslie paid
                    them followed by George and now Patrick. Uncle George passed in 2004. Tax records would be nice to see.
                    Can we do that online? Will Freddy Sherwood be able to help us figure out how to contact Jamaica
                    property tax office? Records or fragments of records and notes seem to be scattered among family
                    members. There seems to be no physical address for the Resource property. It needs to have it's
                    boundaries surveyed. Road to it is being upgraded (cut and paved). Ownership of the property and
                    proposed uses of it is an urgent topic needing discussion. Are there deeds or titles? Family ownership
                    or ? Legal ownership and title to the land is unclear. Should Patrick be reimbursed for his work on the
                    property. Use a gofundme for reimbursment? Survey at the reunion about knowledge and interest in
                    resource.
