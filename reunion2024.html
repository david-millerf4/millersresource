                </h1>
                <h2>Meeting April 20, 2024</h2>
                <b>Attendees:</b> Sharon, Jenneif, Carol, Harriette, David, Hope, Michell, Marlene, Mark
                <h2>Topics</h2>
                <b>Reunion lodging:</b> Marriott and Staybridge are right across the street from each other, so very close.
                Marriott plain rooms for the $169 price. The Staybridge Hotel rooms will be more like suites. They will have stoves, microwaves, and refrigerators.
                Meet and Greet: will be at the Staybridge.
                <b>Dues:</b> Details were discussed. Set at $25/per person. Bank account is set up and ready. Carol and Harriette are joint. Access through Zell or a check. Discussion of access methods: email and phone numbers to use.
                <b>Committee meetings:</b> none so far. Need to get one set up for food committee to get work up a menu.
                <b>Attendees</b> Number and breakdown of attendees still not final. Adults and children.
                <b>Activities:</b> Dependent on interest and number of children. Discussion of where to have activities; inside or outside. Type and length of activities. Noted that Tiara, on activities committee, was thinking of combined activities for adults and children. Watch a school baseball game nearby. Possible Zumba class.
                <b>Genealogy:</b> Hope shared information she has printed from Ancestry. People with Ancestry or Family Search would share their trees with whoever wanted to see them. Noted that spellings and dates sometimes varied widely. Different documens have different spellings of names. Influenced by whoever was writing the record at the time. Discussion of Mimi's family tree and the Hazels. Sometimes formerly the Jamaican registrar's put the birthday as the registration day and not the actual date of birth. Same with the spelling used by the Registrar, misspelled names went uncorrected. Search for Carol's family data.
                <b>T-Shirts</b> Discussion of cost, design, color, style (collar or none) order sizes. Maybe just re-use the previous design.
